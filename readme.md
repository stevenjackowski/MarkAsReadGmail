# Mark Unread Gmail Messages as Read

This is a quick script built using the Gmail API to mark email messages within your inbox as read. The script will prompt the user to input a date, and all messages received before the provided date will be marked as read.

To run the script, you will first need to follow the steps [here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python) to create an authentication file. Once you download the client_secret.json file, it should be placed in the same directory as the file.
